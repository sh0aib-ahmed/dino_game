# Console Game in C++
This project is a simple console-based game written in C++ using basic graphics and user interaction. It demonstrates the use of console manipulation, character rendering, and basic game logic.

## Features
Graphics: Uses console characters to render game elements.
User Interaction: Allows user to control the game using keyboard inputs.
Game Mechanics: Includes jumping mechanics and obstacle collision detection.
Scorekeeping: Displays the score based on gameplay performance.
## How It Works
Display Initialization: The game sets up the console screen, displays instructions, and prepares the game area.
Game Loop: Continuously updates the game state and renders graphics while checking for user inputs.
User Controls:
Press Space to make the character jump.
Press X to exit the game.
Object Movement: An obstacle moves across the screen, and the player must avoid it to continue scoring.
Score Display: The game keeps track of the score and updates it as the player successfully navigates obstacles.
## Code Overview
gotoxy(int x, int y): Moves the cursor to the specified coordinates on the console.
delay(unsigned int mseconds): Pauses the execution for a specified amount of time.
getup(): Sets up the initial game display.
ds(int jump=0): Renders the character, with optional jump mechanics.
obj(): Manages obstacle movement and collision detection.
main(): Contains the game loop and handles user input.
## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run this game:
Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports <conio.h> and <windows.h>.
Compile the code using a command like g++ -o game game.cpp.
Run the executable: ./game.

### Note: This game is designed for Windows environments due to its use of Windows-specific libraries.
